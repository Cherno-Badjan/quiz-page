                When the first novel of the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, opens, it is apparent that
                some significant event has taken place in the wizarding world â€“ an event so very remarkable that even
                Muggles (non-magical people) notice signs of it. The full background to this event and Harry Potter's
                past is revealed gradually throughout the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward
                to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and it is at this point that his magical
                background begins to be revealed.

                Despite Harry's aunt and uncle's desperate prevention of Harry learning about his abilities, their
                efforts are in vain. Harry meets a half-giant, Rubeus Hagrid, who is also his first contact with the
                wizarding world. Hagrid reveals himself to be the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts as well as some
                of Harry's history.[ Harry learns that, as a baby, he witnessed his parents' murder by the
                power-obsessed dark wizard Lord Voldemort (more commonly known by the magical community as You-Know-Who
                or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and by Albus Dumbledore as Tom Marvolo Riddle) who subsequently attempted
                to kill him as well.Instead, the unexpected happened: Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar
                on his forehead as a memento of the attack, and Voldemort disappeared soon afterwards, gravely weakened
                by his own rebounding curse.

                As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror, Harry has become a living legend in the
                wizarding world. However, at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard Albus Dumbledore, the
                orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant Muggle relatives, the Dursleys, who have
                kept him safe but treated him poorly, including confining him to a cupboard without meals and treating
                him as their servant. Hagrid then officially invites Harry to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
                Wizardry, a famous magic school in Scotland that educates young teenagers on their magical development
                for seven years, from age eleven to seventeen.

                With Hagrid's help, Harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study at Hogwarts. As Harry
                begins to explore the magical world, the reader is introduced to many of the primary locations used
                throughout the series. Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: Ron
                Weasley, a fun-loving member of an ancient, large, happy, but poor wizarding family, and Hermione
                Granger, a gifted, bright, and hardworking witch of non-magical parentage.Harry also encounters
                the school's potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a conspicuously deep and abiding dislike for
                him, the rich brat Draco Malfoy whom he quickly makes enemies with, and the Defence Against the Dark
                Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who later turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort. He also discovers
                a talent of flying on broomsticks and is recruited for his house's Quidditch team, a sport in the
                wizarding world where players fly on broomsticks. The first book concludes with Harry's second
                confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power of the
                Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life and turns any metal into pure gold.
